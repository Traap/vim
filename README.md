# Vim
The piece parts I use to personalize Vim.

## Installation 
#### **WARNING:** There [be dragons](https://github.com/tpope/tpope) here (paraphrased).
I have customized my Vim/neovim setup to operate on linux, macunix, and
win32unix.  I set up Vim with following simple steps.

```bash
cd 
mkdir -p git
cd ~/git
rm -rf ~/git/vim
git clone https://github.com:Traap/vim.git
vim
```
*Watch the magic!!!*

## Overview
I use different methods to install Vim and Neovim.  I use the steps listed above
if I choose to reset my environment or after installing Vim or NeoVim.  The
files listed below are sourced by vimrc.  The installation follows a precise
order to orchestrate the setup.

### vimrc

```vim
" s:vim_home defines the location of my Vim preferences.
let s:vim_home = '$HOME/git/vim/'

" s:vim_ssh represents the private repository for my public and private keys. 
let s:vim_ssh = '$HOME/git/ssh/'

" s:config_list concatenates s:vim_home or s:vim_ssh with the appropriate
" component. 
let s:config_list = 
                \ [ s:vim_home . 'bootstrap.vim'
                \ , s:vim_home . 'autoload/plug.vim'
                \ , s:vim_home . 'plug.vim'
                \ , s:vim_ssh  . 'config.vim'
                \ ]

" Iterate s:config_list to kick-start Vim. 
for files in s:config_list
  for f in split(expand(files), '\n')
    exec 'source '.f
  endfor
endfor

``` 

### bootstrap.vim
I use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) to manage Vim plugins.
bootstrap.vim installs [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) when
necessary.

```vim
let vimplug_exists=expand('~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim')

if !filereadable(vimplug_exists)
  if !executable("curl")
    echoerr "You have to install curl or first install vim-plug yourself!"
    execute "q!"
  endif
  echo "Installing Vim-Plug..."
  echo ""
  silent !\curl -fLo ~/.vim/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs
    \ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim
  let g:not_finish_vimplug = 1 
else
  let g:not_finish_vimplug = 0 
endif
```

### plug.vim
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is used.  I install two types
of plugins:
1. Community plugs are listed alphabetically when possible.
2. I have public repositories for each community plugin that I customize.  I use
   vim-bundle-xyz for my bundle patterns.  A bundle may reference
   personalization for one or more community plugin.   As an example,
   [vim-bundle-settings](https://github.com/Traap/vim-bundle-settings) was
   heavily inspired by [Steve Losh](https://github.com/sjl).
3. Automatically install plugins when needed is detected in plug.vim.  The
   code snippet is shown below.
```vim
if g:not_finish_vimplug
  autocmd VimEnter * PlugInstall --sync | source $MYVIMRC
endif
```

### config.vim
Connect to my private and public keys.

### Symbolic links
I use symbolic links from $HOME to .vim, .vimrc, and .vimrc_background so that
my Vim environment is controlled.

## History
I started using Vim during my Christmas 2015 work break.  I chose Vim because I
needed an editor that I could use consistently across various Linux, OSX, and
Windows environments.  I only knew how to start and exit Vim.  I could not do
the same with Emacs.  

I started my journey searching [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) for Vim.  I
was amazed at what I leaned.  I saw men, women, and college students showing how
they used Vim to increase their productivity.  The creativity I witnessed amazed
me. -- I was hooked!

## Acknowledgments
I learned about dotfiles, Vim, TMUX, and so much more.  I am listing Vim
contributors I followed when I began.

1. [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope) prolific is an understatement.  I
   started with [Fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) and
   [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).   
2. [Steve Losh](https://github.com/sjl) challenged me to think differently.
   [Learning Vimscript the Hard Way](https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/)
   guided me.  I backlogged items to study. 

3. [Junegunn Choi](https://github.com/junegunn/) nearly caused my heart to stop
   with [vim-easy-align](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-easy-align).  I cannot
   count the months, days, hours, and minutes I have wasted using
   'repeated-space-key-pattern' to align text.
   [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf),
   [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim),  and
   [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) have my lasted updates
   possible.

4. [James Morrin](https://github.com/treasonx) vimrc and OSX setups were
   studied.  

5. [Chris Toomey](https://github.com/christoomey) has two excellent plugins
   [vim-tmux-navigator](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator) and
   [vim-tmux-runner](https://github.com/christoomey/vim-tmux-runner) that I used
   to learn Tmux.

6. [Karl Yngve Lerv√•g](https://github.com/lervag) increased my LaTeX
   productivity with [vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex).

I learned from many others, also.  There are too many to name.

## Why the [vim-bundle-xxx](https://github.com/Traap/vim-bundle-settings) Pattern?
Are you Nuts?  The short answer is **YES**!

Naming conventions are essential axioms to well-written programs.   I needed a
construct that was just another Vim plugin.

I spend a significant amount of time breaking and rebuilding computers.  I have
had four computers physically break within the last six months: motherboards,
disk drives, monitors, and more. Rebuilding computers quickly is in my DNA.

The bottom line is simple, *my computers are not Traap proof.*

My goal was to type Vim have it automatically bootstrap itself.  I also want to
experiment with Vim plugins and settings. Now that I use
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), I can safely comment out a few
[plug](https://github.com/Traap/vim/blob/master/plug.vim)  lines without much
effort.  I have
a [minimal]((https://github.com/Traap/vim/blob/master/minimial-plug.vim) setup
I use to help people learn vim or neovim.

I centrally located my
[vim-bundle-keybindings](https://github.com/Traap/vim-bundle-keybindings/blob/master/plugin/bundle-keybindings.vim).
LaTeX the primary language I use for writing documents.  I personalized
[vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) with
[vim-bundle-vimtex](https://github.com/Traap/vim-bundle-vimtex/blob/master/plugin/bundle-vimtex.vim).
These simple abstractions support [loose
coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)) and
[high cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science)) I try
practice.
